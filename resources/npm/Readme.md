# How To Use Npm in Your Workflow
NPM is short for short for Node Package Manager it can help you with the installation and management of tooling you want to use in your javascript projects. For instance lets say you want to use bootstrap as the HTML/CSS framework for developing a prototype app. 

## Pre Flight Check
You will need to have Node installed on your computer.  
To check if node is installed on your operating system open the code editor or operating system terminal and type the following command. 
```bash
   node --version
```  

You should see output similar to the following snippet below. If you get a warning that node can't be found it means that you will have to go download and install it.  

```bash
    v14.9.0
```  
 For instructions on how to do this do a google search on how to install node on your operating system. You can download the node installers for mac and windows from the [node.js site](https://nodejs.org/en/)  
- macOS I like to use brew
- windows I use the installer from the node js site.  

__YOU NOW SHOULD HAVE NODE INSTALLED__

## Check NPM Version  
To check that everything went to plan again open the terminal and type either of the following commands. You should see a version number if you don't you either have a problem with your install or node is not installed on the computer.
```bash
   node --version
   npm --version
```
