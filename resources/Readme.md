# Workspace Tooling & Set Up.
As you progress as a JavaScript developer you will want to add more tooling to your workflow. Tooling allows you to perform faster and helps you out with common tasks.  

The following list of folder in the repo are all basic workspace tools to help you perform at peak level.  

```bash
workspace
├── browser-extensions
├── emmet
├── eslint
├── local-development-server
├── prettier
└── vscode-extensions
```

- Browser Extensions  
List of extensions you may find helpful to install in your browser.  

- Emmet  
This is a must learn tool for speeding up your HTML markup workflow. It takes about one hour to learn and will save you hundreds of yours when marking up content.

- ESlint  
On the eslint home page it says "find and fix problems in your javascript code". Not much else you can say about that.

- Local Development Server  
How to install and configure a local development server so that you don't have to upload files to an external server that waists time when it could be better spent elsewhere.

- Prettier
Straight from the Prettier website "an opinionated code formatter". Prettier and ESlint are usually paired together.  

- VSCode Extensions
This is just a listing of some of the VSCode extensions that I use when developing client side javascript.  

- ESlint-Prettier-Airbnb
These three tools go hand in hand. Once your on your way to being a front end developer you may want to take a look at configuring these three tools together for your workspace.

- Gulp
Gulp is a task runner that helps us when doing client side development to automate slow, repetitive workflows and compose them into efficient build pipelines.
