### Exercise
Create an HTML file called index.html and a javascript file called console.js. Link the javascript file to the html file and using the console method consele.log() log out to the console the message "javascript file is attached to the html file"
 
### Exercise
Open your browser of choice. Each browser has its own set of developer tools. Learn how to open and close the developer console using the quick key combination for the browser you like to work with. Once you have the hand of opening and closing the browser dev tools open the console and use the console.log(), console.clear(), console.(warn), console.error() methods. Remember that text goes between the brackets and any text you type should be inserted using single quotes.

### Exercise
Download and open the ex-1 folder in your favourite code editor. I am using VSCode. I want you too hook up a javascript files that you will have to create and name it app.js. Conect the JavaScript  file and the HTML file index.html together using the script tag and place it the script tag before the closing HTML tag.

```javascript
// In the app.js file create a console.log()method.
// to add a message/output to the console place your text inside the brackets.
// add the text you want to output to the console in single tags.
// go to the browser dev tools console tab do you see your output.
console.log( 'JavaScript file is now linked to the HTML markup')
```
